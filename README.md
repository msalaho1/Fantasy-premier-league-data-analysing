Extracting and visualizing data of the premier league players

first i used python to web scrape the fantasy premier league API and processed data and filtered them to store the useful data as an Excel file
Next i used python to visualizing some useful data about top expected players to score next week 
i used tableau public to make a dashboard of these data
